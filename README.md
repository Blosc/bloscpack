# bloscpack

Command line interface to Blosc via python-blosc

## Description

This script provides a command line interface to
[Blosc](http://blosc.pytables.org/trac) a high performance, multi-threaded,
blocking and shuffeling compressor. The interface is realized by using the
[argparse](http://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html) library
and [python-blosc](https://github.com/FrancescAlted/python-blosc) bindings.

## Dependencies

* Python 2.7
* [python-blosc](https://github.com/FrancescAlted/python-blosc) (provides Blosc)

## Installation

Place the file ``bloscpack`` somewhere in your ``$PATH``.

## Usage

    zshÂ» ./bloscpack --help
    usage: bloscpack [-h] [--version] [--verbose] [--force] [--typesize <size>]
                     [--clevel {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}] [--no-shuffle]
                     [--no-check-extension] (-c | -d)
                     <in_file> [[<out_file>]]

    command line de/compression with blosc

    positional arguments:
      <in_file>             file to be de/compressed
      [<out_file>]          file to de/compress to

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --version             show program's version number and exit
      --verbose             be verbose about actions
      --force               disable overwrite checks for existing files
                            (use with caution)
      -c, --compress        perform compression on <in_file>
      -d, --decompress      perform decompression on <in_file>

    compression only:
      --typesize <size>     typesize for blosc, default = 4
      --clevel {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
                            compression level, default = 7
      --no-shuffle          deactivate shuffle

    decompression only:
      --no-check-extension  disable checking input file for extension (*.blp)
                            (requires use of <out_file>)
