What is it?
===========

Bloscpack is a command-line interface and serialization format for
Blosc. Blosc (http://www.blosc.org) is an extremely fast meta-codec
designed for high compression speeds. Bloscpack allows you to use Blosc
from the command-line to compress and decompress files. Additionally,
Bloscpack has a Python-API that allows you to compress and serialize
data to a file system. Additionally, Bloscpack supports efficient
serialization and de-serialization of Numpy arrays and might in fact be
one of the fastest ways to save arrays to disk. Bloscpack uses the
Python bindings for Blosc (http://python-blosc.blosc.org/) under the
hood.
